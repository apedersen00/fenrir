## Test Summary

### ✅ Basic Functionality Tests
- Event capture module: PASSED
- Convolution module: PASSED  
- Pooling module: PASSED

### ✅ Integration Tests
- Top-level SNN processor: PASSED
- Pipeline flow: PASSED
- Enable/disable functionality: PASSED
- BRAM arbitration: PASSED

### ✅ File-Based Verification
- Input event processing: PASSED
- Memory state verification: PASSED
- Spike output verification: PASSED

## Configuration
- Image size: 16x16 pixels
- Channels: 4 output channels
- Kernel size: 3x3 convolution
- Pool size: 2x2 pooling windows
- Neuron bit width: 9 bits

## Test Vectors
- Input events: test_vectors/input_events.txt
- Expected outputs: test_vectors/expected_spikes.txt
- Configuration: test_vectors/config.txt

## Files Verified
$(find . -name "*.vhd" | grep -v tb_ | sort)

## Next Steps
1. For Vivado synthesis: Use the verified VHDL files
2. For further testing: Modify generate_tests.py for different scenarios
3. For debugging: Check wave.vcd for signal traces
